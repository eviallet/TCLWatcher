# How it works

A list of the stations and their positions is downloaded from [here](https://download.data.grandlyon.com/wfs/rdata?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=2.0.0&outputformat=GEOJSON&maxfeatures=100000&request=GetFeature&typename=tcl_sytral.tclarret) and stored in a local db. Their position is used to show the user the final route with [osmdroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) and their name to autocomplete the queries.
